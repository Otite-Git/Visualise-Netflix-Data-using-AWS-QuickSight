# üíªVisualise-Netflix-Data-using-AWS-QuickSight‚òÅÔ∏è


Hi! Welcome to my repository containing my AWS Project I've have undertaken as an AWS expert and Cloud enthusiast‚ö°Ô∏è:

In this repository you will see a description of the project, high level architecture, scripting files and information on other key assets that I have used to develop this project as part of my portfolio.


## **Project Overview** 

This project consists of using AWS QuickSight which helps in effectively analysing data and through creating visualisations. As part of this project, I will analyse a huge dataset of Netflix shows and movies to create a dashboard that extracts all the interesting insights
