# üíªVisualise Netflix Data using AWS QuickSight‚òÅÔ∏è


Hi! Welcome to my repository containing my AWS Project I've have undertaken as an AWS expert and Cloud enthusiast‚ö°Ô∏è:

In this repository you will see a description of the project, high level architecture, scripting files and information on other key assets that I have used to develop this project as part of my portfolio.


## **Project Overview** 

This project consists of using AWS QuickSight which helps in effectively analysing data and through creating visualisations. As part of this project, I will analyse a huge dataset of Netflix shows and movies to create a dashboard that extracts all the interesting insights

## **Architecture**

1. **Amazon S3:** Enables environmental file storage.
2. **Amazon Quicksight:** Enables users to visualise data, perform analysis, and share insights through interactive dashboards, reports, and charts.



## **Deployment Steps**
 ### Dataset Configuration
 1. The datasets which used for this project have been put together and can be found in the repository file section of this repository. They are titled ! [netflix_titles.csv](https://storage.googleapis.com/nextwork_course_resources/courses/aws/AWS%20Project%20People%20projects/Project%3A%20Visualise%20Data%20using%20Amazon%20QuickSight/netflix_titles.csv) and [manifest.json.](https://storage.googleapis.com/nextwork_course_resources/courses/aws/AWS%20Project%20People%20projects/Project%3A%20Visualise%20Data%20using%20Amazon%20QuickSight/manifest.json)

 ### Dataset storage in Amazon S3
 1. Open the S3 Console on AWS and select create Bucket.
 2. Name the bucket 'nextwork-quicksight-project-name' (replace with'name' your name).
 3. Region select would be depended on the region closet to the individual. On this basis, Select the region closest to you.
 4. Keep the rest of the setting as default and select 'create bucket'.
 5. Upload the CSV file and the 'manifest.json'file into the bucket.
 6. Copy the S3 URL of your ' netflix_titles.csv' file.
    ![Uploaded files and URI copied](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48726cf7-d96b-4fe2-922a-0a4254928152)
7. Open your 'manifest.json' file in your laptop's text editor - for example, TextEdit (Mac) or Notepad (Windows).
8. Replace the URI in the 'manifest.json' file with the S3 URI of your dataset. It is important to edit this file because the URIs needs to accurately reflect the object location.
9. Re-upload the edited 'manifest.json'file into your bucket, which you'll notice automatically replaces the existing one.

### Create your Amazon QuickSight account
1. Within the AWS Management Console, search and sigh up for Amazon QuickSight.
2. Sign up for a free trial of the 'Enterprise' edition if you don't have an account.
3. Make sure you uncheck this offer to upgrade box below:

4. Enter your details for your QuickSight account ensuring the email used is the same email as your AWS account.
5. Select 'S3 Bucket' and select 'Select S3 Buckets'.

8. Select 'Create'to then ctreate the Amazon QuickSight account.


### Connecting the S3 bucket to Amazon QuickSight
1. From the left hand navigation bar, select 'Datasets'  then 'New dataset'.
2. Select 'S3'.
3. For the first field (source name), enter 'kaggle-netflix-data'.
4. Open a new tab to open your AWS Management Console again. Head back to your S3 bucket.
5. Select the checkbox next to 'manifest.json', then select 'Copy S3 URL'.

7. Select 'Visualise'.
8. Select'Create'.
9. Select 'Interactive sheet' to start creating visualisations.

### Create Your QuickSight Visualisation
1. QuickSight, allows for sorting, filtering, and customisation of data top create visualisations. experimentation can also take place with different types of graphs like bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, etc.
2. On the left hand panel the dataset's fields are already imported.

3. I have dragged 'release_year' into the Y-Axis heading to see a breakdown on the year that these Netflix-featured TV shows and movies were released.

8. Here is an example of a data sheet created which reflects data on the different movie releases between specific time periods.

### Adding titles to Visualisation
1. It is important for data to have titles that accurately reflect the information displayed. To add a title doouble click  titles of the charts you see in front of you.
2. The 'Edit Title' page will pop up. Enter the title to best describe the data which is being displayed.
